### 01. Why do I use Python in DevOps?
- If we are working with both `Winows and Linux` environment, then python scripting is important. Shell scripting works only on Linux OS.
- Since the foundation of Ansible is Python, it comes handy as well.
- When we have to work on `complex tasks` (Intaracting with APIs, Data Manupulation), python is more superior over Shell scripting.
  
### 02. Shell Scripting vs Python Scripting?

| Feature                  | Shell Scripting                                      | Python Scripting                                     |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Direct OS Interaction**| Excellent for interacting directly with the OS       | Requires libraries for deeper OS interaction         |
| **Performance**          | Efficient for simple, small tasks                    | Higher overhead, slower for simple tasks             |
| **Built-in Commands**    | Rich set of built-in commands and utilities          | Requires importing libraries for additional commands |
| **Ease of Use**          | Easier for simple automation tasks                   | More complex but more powerful for larger tasks      |
| **Syntax**               | Complex and less readable for large scripts          | Clear and readable                                   |
| **Portability**          | Less portable, system-specific commands              | Highly portable across different OS                  |
| **Error Handling**       | Basic error handling                                 | Robust error handling                                |
| **Library Support**      | Limited to built-in utilities                        | Extensive standard library and third-party modules   |
| **Programming Paradigms**| Primarily procedural                                 | Supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional |
| **Use Cases**            | System administration, file manipulation             | Data processing, web scraping, complex automation    |
| **Dependencies**         | No external dependencies                             | May require additional libraries or modules          |

## When to Use

### Shell Scripting
- Starting and stopping services
- Batch renaming files
- Simple backup scripts
- System monitoring and reporting
- Automating routine OS tasks

### Python Scripting
- Data processing and analysis
- Web scraping and API interactions
- Complex automation tasks
- Cross-platform scripts
- Tasks requiring better error handling and maintainability
